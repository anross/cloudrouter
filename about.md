**Vision**

The CloudRouter Project is a collaborative open source project focused on developing a 
powerful, easy to use router designed for the cloud.

Compute resources are rapidly migrating from physical infrastructure to a combination of
 physical, virtual and cloud environments. A similar transition is emerging in the networking
 space, with network control logic shifting from proprietary hardware-based platforms to open
 source software-based platforms. CloudRouter is a software-based router designed to run on
 physical, virtual and cloud environments, supporting software-defined networking
 infrastructure. It includes the features of traditional hardware routers, as well as support
 for emerging technologies such as containers and software-defined interconnection.
 CloudRouter aims to facilitate migration to the cloud without giving up control over network
 routing and governance.

**Key features**

* Full-stack SDN implementation including OpenDaylight
* Standards-based interfaces
* Built on the rock-solid foundation of Linux
* Monitoring and availability
* Support for containers and cloud images

**Architecture &amp; design goals**

* Optimized for interconnection
* Run in the cloud or on-premise
* Flexible build system supporting multiple distribution formats
* Easy to use and configure
* Security as a core feature, not an afterthought
* High performance with minimal resource consumption
* Highly scalable
