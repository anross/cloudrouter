title: 'OpenDaylight openflowplugin allows topology spoofing via LLDP'

description: 'It has been reported that it is possible for an attacker to spoof
  networking topology via LLDP. An attacker can inject crafted LLDP packets that
  announce internal links between switches, thereby affecting the flow of data in
  the SDN network. Further technical details are available in a conference paper.'
