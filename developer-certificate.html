<p>(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or</p>
<p>(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or</p>
<p>(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.</p>
